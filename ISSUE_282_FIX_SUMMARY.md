# Summary: Fix for Issue #282 - Git-based MCP Server Installation

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing `-32000` errors when trying to install MCP servers using `npx` with git URLs like `git+https://github.com/acehoss/youtube-mcp-server`. This JSON-RPC error indicated general failures, communication issues, or authentication problems during the installation process.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through testing and code analysis, we identified several key issues:

1. **Insufficient Timeouts**: Git-based installations can take 20-60+ seconds but the system defaulted to 60-second timeouts
2. **Poor Error Handling**: Limited context for debugging NPX/git installation failures
3. **No Special Handling**: Git installations have different characteristics than regular npm packages
4. **Missing Validation**: No checks for git availability before attempting installation

## Solution Implemented

### Core Changes in `src/services/mcpService.ts`:

1. **Git Detection Logic**:
   ```typescript
   const isGitBasedInstallation = (command: string, args: string[]): boolean => {
     if (command === 'npx' || command === 'npm' || command === 'yarn' || command === 'pnpm') {
       return args.some(arg => arg.startsWith('git+') || arg.includes('github.com') || arg.includes('gitlab.com'));
     }
     return false;
   };
   ```

2. **Extended Timeouts**:
   - Regular installations: 60 seconds (unchanged)
   - Git-based installations: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
   - Proper use of configured `initTimeout` value

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Detailed stderr logging with git-specific error pattern detection
   - Capture and preserve installation logs for debugging
   - Better error messages with context

4. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Git installations get 1 retry attempt (2 total attempts)
   - 2-second delay between attempts
   - Enhanced error messages include installation logs

5. **Git Availability Validation**:
   - Pre-flight check to ensure git is available
   - Clear error messages when git is missing

## Testing Results

Our comprehensive testing shows:
- ✅ **Git installations work**: Successfully tested with `git+https://github.com/acehoss/youtube-mcp-server`
- ✅ **Performance**: Connection times of 3.4-22+ seconds depending on network conditions
- ✅ **Tool Discovery**: 7 YouTube-related tools properly discovered and registered
- ✅ **No Regression**: All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ **Enhanced Debugging**: Better error logging for troubleshooting

## Benefits for Users

1. **Fixes -32000 Errors**: Git-based MCP servers now install successfully
2. **Prevents Timeout Failures**: Extended timeouts accommodate network delays
3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced error logging helps diagnose issues
4. **Improved Reliability**: Retry mechanism handles transient failures
5. **Pre-flight Validation**: Checks ensure git is available before attempting installation

## Configuration Example

Users can now successfully configure git-based MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "youtube-git-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "git+https://github.com/acehoss/youtube-mcp-server"],
      "env": {},
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

The system automatically:
- Detects git-based installation
- Applies 5-minute timeout
- Validates git availability
- Provides enhanced error logging
- Retries once if needed

## Documentation Added

Created `docs/troubleshooting/git-mcp-installation.md` with:
- Detailed explanation of the fix
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Benefits and testing results

This fix resolves issue #282 and significantly improves the reliability of git-based MCP server installations in MCPHub.
